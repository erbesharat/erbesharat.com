I’m a software engineer with a love for open-source projects, network engineering, and distributed systems. If there’s a way to make tech work smarter, faster, and more reliably, that’s where you’ll find me. Outside of coding, I’m usually immersed in a game of Dota 2 or exploring the worlds of other video games. For me, both coding and gaming are about solving puzzles and finding the best path forward.

Right now, I run a software consultancy in the Netherlands with a few of my talented friends. Together, we help businesses tackle tough tech challenges, bringing years of experience across DevOps, backend, and frontend development. We believe in building tech that’s not only effective but easy to maintain and scale.

What I love most about my work is the opportunity to learn something new every day. Since I was a little kid reading comic books, I’ve been fascinated by the idea of a world where anything is possible. With coding, I get to create that world, one line of code at a time. I’m always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible with tech, whether that’s through a new project, a new language, or a new solution to an old problem.

In the past, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from SaaS products, hotel and logistics management tools to video games. I enjoy collaborating with people who want to make tech more open, accessible, and reliable. If that sounds like you, feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear about your ideas or just grab a coffee and chat.
